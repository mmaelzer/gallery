Just a note on compatibility:
* Chrome doesn't like it when you perform ajax calls on local files
* FF/Safari render fine
* IE9 has a minor mouse hover quirk on the buttons
* IE8 has some rendering issues on the buttons

Things I'd like to improve upon:
Fix the IE styling issues
More comments

The backbone.js models/collections/views/router should, in theory, be in seperate files, but for easier reading, I kept them in a single file.
