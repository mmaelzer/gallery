Gallery
=====================

Just a simple photo gallery app I made while playing around with backbone.js

Compatibility
-----------------------------
* Chrome doesn't like it when you perform ajax calls on files on the filesystem. In other words, if you try to run this as-is, it won't work in Chrome until you pull from a web server.
* FF/Safari render fine
* IE9 has a minor mouse hover quirk on the buttons
* IE8 has some rendering issues on the buttons

Todo
------------------------------
* Fix the IE styling issues
* More comments
* Pull the not-my-js files out of this repo
